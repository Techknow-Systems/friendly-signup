# Friendly Signup for Wordpress
A Mailchimp signup plugin for Wordpress that is Friendly to you and your users. 

## Features
The Friendly Signup plugin inspires users to sign up to your list rather through slide in boxes, tactful overlays and squeeze page forms that can be fully designed through Wordpress Admin pages. This plugin makes a move away from annoying popups on page entry and exit that frustrate users and move them off-site quickly.

Friendly Signup for Wordpress highlights include:
* Scroll activated slide in sign up boxes that can slide in from any direction.
* Tacftul overlays that can be used as email walls to premium content.
* Sign up forms that can be used for landing pages.
* All signup styles can be fully designed and styled through the Wordpress Admin pages.
* Full control of where the sign up forms appear on your website.
* Cookie control.
* Uses the Mailchimp REST API v3

The Friendly Signup for Wordpress plugin is built using the [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate)
